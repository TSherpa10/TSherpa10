Hi, my name is Tashi Sherpa!

some things about me:
 - I am a rising junior computer science major at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI)
 - I like to play Nintendo Switch games, explore new food spots, and take photos in my free time.
 - I love to work in a team-setting (I prefer both generalist and specialist-type of work) with friends.
